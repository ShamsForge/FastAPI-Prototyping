#FastAPI Prototypes Projects!

This repository is where I experimented with FastAPI for quick backend projects.

## Why FastAPI?

Super fast to set up.
No hassle to build APIs.

## The best Part?

Let me test ideas first, switch language/framework later if I want.

## My Goal
I use FastAPI for prototyping. Then turn that code into Express.js or Golang, whichever I decide

Project Info:

1. Simple/Experimental API Projects
2. Boilerplate code that I reuse sometimes
